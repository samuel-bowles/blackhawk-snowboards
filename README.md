 WIT Individual Project - A snowbaord brand/shop website.

This was an individual project for the Web Creator course at Waseda IT school.
For this project I was the designer and coder for the website.
I wanted to display the main product in an interesting way and used the 3d model viewer provided by Google to accomplish this.
